 A program to solve bombs created by the game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://www.bombmanual.com/)

## Gui 
The ui's for this project were developed with [Qt for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html). As a reminder to myself, the cmd line script needed to convert from .ui to .py file is here

```pyuic6 -o mainWindow.py -x mainWindow.ui```
